# **üìúPROJECT DESCRIPTION:**          
These are some of the miniature projects i did through out my journey of studying python. 
They have enhanced and motivated me to study python in more fun and entertaining way.      
GeeksForGeeks have been my maijor study material for the accomplishment of the project.   
Some of the codes were outdated in geeksforgeeks which made me realise that i can solve problems by figuring out solutions myself.
I hope the codes are clear and helpful :D
